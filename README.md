# workday_scheduler

## Description

I incorporated Day.JS into this simple workday scheduler.  Depending on what time is showing at the top of the browser (the current time) the hour line-items within the calendar will auto-update to the correct color coordinating which denotes grey/past, red/current, and green/future.

The user of this application also has the ability to enter in quick text notes and save the note to the calendar.  The note is saved in local storage, so if the browser is closed out for whatever reason, the note within the calendar is saved. 
## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website is intended to be a learning exercise for the things I've been learning in javascript and Day.JS as the bootcamp course progresses.  There be some more updates in the future as I learn more.
